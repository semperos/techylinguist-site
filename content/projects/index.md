## My Projects ##

The following are projects I either maintain or am heavily involved in. Note that the Ruby projects, while not abandoned, do not receive much attention in comparison to the Clojure ones.

 * [clj-webdriver](https://github.com/semperos/clj-webdriver): A Clojure library for automated web testing using Selenium-WebDriver as the backend.
 * [clj-jgit](https://github.com/semperos/clj-jgit): A Clojure wrapper around the Java JGit library.
 * [log4clj](https://github.com/semperos/log4clj): Clojure helpers for using log4j in code (as opposed via XML or properties files).
 * RobotFramework libraries
     * [watir-robot](https://github.com/semperos/watir-robot) A remote keyword library for RobotFramework that leverages Watir-WebDriver for automated web testing.
     * [robot-remote-server-rb](https://github.com/semperos/robot-remote-server-rb) Remote server implementation in Ruby, providing advancements over default Ruby remote server that ships with RobotFramework.
     * [robot-remote-server-clj](https://github.com/semperos/robot-remote-server-clj) A Clojure implementation of the same remote server used with RobotFramework.

To be honest, clj-webdriver is the only project that receives ongoing updates and for which I have an actual development plan.
