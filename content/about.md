## About ##

My name is <%= @item[:author] %> (semperos around the Internet). I write open source software in Clojure and Ruby. I currently work for Berico Technologies, LLC, where I get to hack on open source software while helping government clients.

This site is a repository for code and notes accrued during my work with open source software.
